# Apple's Organizational Model


## General Setup in Apple's Corporate Structure 

-  business leaders have full control over key functions in their unit 

    - This allows them to do what is best to meet their customers needs and thus maximize their results 

- Due to its closeness to technological developments leaders at Apple need comprehensive expertise in their respective technical fields/immersion in technical details/collaborative debate


### _Apple relies on an organizational structure which centers on functional expertise_

- **The key belief is that those people with the most expertise and experience in a domain should have decision rights for this domain**

- Apple competes in markets characterized with quick rates of technological change and a high chance of technological disruption 

    - The company must rely on people with sound judgment and intuition 

    - Long before Apple can get market feedback and market forecasts 

    - Thus Apple prefers to rely on technical experts rather than general managers 


- The bonuses of Apple's R&D managers are based on companywide performance indicators 

    - Thus decisions about indvidual products are somewhat isolated from short-term financial pressures 

    - The finance team is not involved in product road maps and product engineers are not involved in pricing decisions
